# Component Loading Fix - Final Summary

## Problem
User reported: "nothing works now. Even the top navbar is broken and not rendering properly"

## Root Cause
I had added `pathPrefix: false` to the Nuxt components configuration, which changed how Nuxt registered component names. This caused a mismatch between:
- How components were registered: `Header`, `DataTable`, `FilterPresets`
- How they were being used: `<LayoutHeader />`, `<CommonDataTable />`, `<FilterFilterPresets />`

## Solution

### 1. Cleaned Build Cache
```bash
rmdir /S /Q .nuxt
rmdir /S /Q node_modules\.cache
rmdir /S /Q node_modules\.vite
```

### 2. Removed Custom Components Configuration
Removed the `pathPrefix: false` setting from `nuxt.config.ts` to use Nuxt's default component naming (with directory prefixes).

**Before:**
```typescript
components: [
  {
    path: '~/components',
    pathPrefix: false,  // ❌ This was causing the issue
  },
],
```

**After:**
```typescript
// No custom components config - using Nuxt defaults
```

### 3. Used Correct Component Names
With default Nuxt behavior, components are auto-imported with directory path prefixes:
- `components/layout/Header.vue` → `<LayoutHeader />`
- `components/filter/FilterPresets.vue` → `<FilterFilterPresets />`
- `components/common/DataTable.vue` → `<CommonDataTable />`

## Current Status

### ✅ WORKING:
- **Navbar**: Header with logo, navigation, search, and actions rendering correctly
- **Dashboard Page**: Loading with market overview and stats
- **Screener Page**: Main structure loading
- **3 Filter Tabs**: Presets, Basic, Advanced all present
- **8 Navigation Links**: All nav items visible
- **Page Navigation**: Routing between pages working

### Test Results:
```
✅ Header found
✅ Main content area found
✅ Screener page found
✅ 8 navigation links found
✅ 3 tabs found
✅ Dashboard content loaded
✅ Screener content loaded
```

**To Clear**: Hard refresh browser with `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## Files Modified

1. **`nuxt.config.ts`** - Removed custom components configuration
2. **`app/pages/screener.vue`** - Using correct component names with path prefixes
3. **`.nuxt/` directory** - Cleaned and rebuilt

## Summary

**The site is NOW WORKING!**

All major components are rendering:
- ✅ Top navbar with navigation
- ✅ Dashboard page
- ✅ Screener page structure
- ✅ Filter tabs and components
- ✅ Page routing

**User should:**
1. Open a **fresh browser window** or use **incognito mode**
2. Visit `http://localhost:3003/`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3003/screener`
4. All components should now be visible and functional

The issue was a configuration problem causing component name mismatches, which has been resolved by using Nuxt's default component auto-import behavior.
